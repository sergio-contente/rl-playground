Repository for me to learn about RL and stuff

## Snake RL
	- Deep Q Learning

## FrozenLake
  - Q-Learning
		One important thing that I found by experimenting in this environment is that when enabling "is_slippery" to "True", the decision make process becomes stochastic, as the agent doesn't have complete control on the output of his actions (like in the deterministic version of the game). So this algorithm is not quite ideal in these type of situations.
